\label{chap:testreports}

During the acceptance test, all tests written in the ATP\ref{atp} succeeded. This means all the user requirements these tests are written for are met. This means requirements \textbf{CPR1, CPR2, CPR3, CPR6, CPR7, CPR8, CPR9, CPR10, CPR11, CPR12, CPR13, CPR17, CPR18, CPR19, CPR20, CPR21, CPR22, CPR23, CPR24, CPR25, CPR29, CPR30, CPR31, CPR32, CPR33, CPR34, CPR35, CPR36, CPR37 and CPR40} are met. All other capability requirements are not implemented, and thus not met. Another conclusion that came from the acceptance tests is that the application does not work efficiently on mobile phones, regardless of operating system. Finally, the application does not have full functionality in Internet Explorer (the graph functionality is not supported).
