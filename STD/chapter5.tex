\chapter{Acceptance test report summary}
\label{chap:testreports}

During the acceptance test, all tests written in the ATP \cite{atp} succeeded, these tests are written in chapter \ref*{ATP-chap:testPlan}. This means all the user requirements these tests are written for are met. These requirements are listed in chapter 2 of the ATP \cite{atp} All other capability requirements are not implemented, and thus not met. Another conclusion from the acceptance tests is that the application does not work efficiently on mobile phones, regardless of operating system. Finally, the graph functionality does not work in Internet Explorer (all versions), and the exporting functionality does not work on iOS Safari (all versions).
