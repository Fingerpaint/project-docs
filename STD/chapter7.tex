\section*{Storing an empty protocol}
Storing an empty protocol is currently possible. The save button that saves a protocol should be disabled when the protocol is empty.

\section*{Show loading}
When the application is busy loading a concentration distribution, the program should display that it is busy loading.

\section*{Stop define protocol inappropriate}
The \emph{stop define protocol} button in the protocol menu should be called \emph{back}, to be consistent with the other \emph{back} buttons.

\section*{Popups should be centered}
Popups should be centered, even when the window is resized.

\section*{Performance graphs should have a logarithmic scale}
The performance graphs should have a logarithmic scale on the y-axis.

\section*{The gray entries are confused with selected entries}
In the \emph{view multiple performance} option, the gray entries in the loading menu are confused with selected entries. They should be more distinguishable.

\section*{Buttons are sometimes unresponsive}
Sometimes button presses do not register, this could be alleviated by making the buttons bigger.

\section*{Responsive cellLists}
While the buttons are now fast, the cellLists used for loading are still slow. They should be sped up.

\section*{Messages should be out of the way}
Messages for \emph{save/remove successful} should be in the corner of the screen, where they do not block buttons.

\section*{Differently coloured back button}
The back buttons should be coloured differently, to make them stand out.

\section*{Remove the CellBrowser}
With only a single geometry, the CellBrowser is rather useless, therefore it should be removed.

\section*{Initial tutorial distribution}
When the application is started, it is unclear how the walls function. For this purpose, a `tutorial distribution' should be made. This tutorial distribution should explain how the walls can be used for mixing.
