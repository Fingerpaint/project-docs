\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
%The purpose of this particular ADD and its intended readership
This Architectural Design Document (ADD) describes the basic design of the \applicationname\ that will be developed by \projectauthor. First of all, it describes how the application is divided into different components. Thereafter, for each component, it describes the dependencies on other components, and the relation to external interfaces.

\section{Scope}
%Scope of the software. Identifies the product by name, explains what the software will do
The \applicationname\ is an application designed and developed by \projectauthor\ for prof.dr.ir. P.D. Anderson, at the Eindhoven University of Technology. The application serves as an education tool for anyone who wants to gain a deeper understanding of the process of mixing in general, and in perticular for students at the TU/e.

\section{Overview}
%Short description of the rest of the ADD and how it is organized.
The remaining chapters describe the architectural design of \projectname\ in more detail. Chapter \ref{chap:systoverview} gives a system overview. Chapter \ref{chap:systcontext} describes the system context. The relationship with external system is explained in detail in this chapter. Chapter \ref{chap:systdesign} covers the sytem design. The name and reference of the used design method are given. In section \ref{sec:decompdescr} a description of the decomposition of the system, and an overview of its components are given.
In chapter \ref{chap:compdescr} all components are described in detail. For each component, its type, purpose, function, subordinates, dependencies to other components, interfaces, resources needed, internal processing and  data are described. Chapter \ref{chap:feasresest} gives an overview of all resources need to build, operate and maintain the application. Chapter \ref{chap:reqtracematrix} contains a traceability matrix. This matrix shows how each software requirement of the SRD \cite{srd} is linked to the components described in the ADD.
