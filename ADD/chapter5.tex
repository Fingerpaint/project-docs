\subsection{Application Persistence}

\subsubsection*{Component identifier}
%A unique identifier
Server.ApplicationPersistence

\subsubsection*{Type}
%Task, procedure, package, program, file, ...
Database.

\subsubsection*{Purpose}
%Software requirements implemented
Provides functionality for the following software requirements:\\
SRQ9, SRQ10, SRQ11
%This are the requirements with labels AP-1, AP-2, AP-4

\subsubsection*{Function}
%What the component does.
This component is the database that contains the different mixers and their information. Mixers can be retrieved from this component for use within the Fortran Module. New mixers can be stored and old fixers can be removed. All the communication to execute these functions is done by the Application Persistence Communication, which is described in section 2.7.3 of the SRD \cite{srd}.

\subsubsection*{Subordinates}
%Child components (modules called, files composed of, classes used)
The Application Persistence does not have any child modules.

\subsubsection*{Dependencies}
%Components to be executed before/after, excluded operations during execution
The Application Persistence component depends on the Application Service component to receive requests from other components. For an overview of dependencies, see figure \ref{fig:compdependencies}.

\subsubsection*{Interfaces}
%Data and control flow in and out
This component it is only accessed through the Application Service component. The Application Persistence Communication is used for this purpose.  \todo{write more about this after consulting Ion}

\subsubsection*{Resources}
%Needed to perform the function
\todo{Ask Ion}

\subsubsection*{References}
%to other documents
The description of the specific requirements, mentioned in the section purpose, can be found in the SRD \cite{srd}.

\subsubsection*{Processing}
%Internal control and data flow
\todo{Follows from the component’s function and interfaces.}

\subsubsection*{Data}
%Internal data
This component is a database containing data that represents the different mixers.

\subsection{HTTP Server}

\subsubsection*{Component identifier}
%A unique identifier
Server.HTTPServer

\subsubsection*{Type}
%Task, procedure, package, program, file, ...
Program.

\subsubsection*{Purpose}
%Software requirements implemented
Provides functionality for the following software requirements:\\
SRQ1, SRQ3, SRQ6, SRQ101, 
%This are the requirements with labels HTTP-1, AS-2, AS-6, returnParams

\subsubsection*{Function}
%What the component does.
The HTTP server is a piece of software that responds to requests by either serving a file from a static collection of content or responding with a dynamically build response. The former is used to serve the actual application, while the latter is used when the client requests a simulation, which goes through the HTTP server as well.

\subsubsection*{Subordinates}
%Child components (modules called, files composed of, classes used)
\todo{I have no idea whatsoever}

\subsubsection*{Dependencies}
%Components to be executed before/after, excluded operations during execution
The HTTP Server component doesn't depend on any other components. For an overview of dependencies, see figure \ref{fig:compdependencies}.

\subsubsection*{Interfaces}
%Data and control flow in and out
This component is accessed through the application service component, the application state component and the update application persistence component. The application service communication is used for the communication with the application service components. For communication with the two components on the client-side of the application, HTTP is used.

\todo{Ask Ion}

\subsubsection*{References}

\subsubsection*{Processing}
%Internal control and data flow
\todo{Follows from the component’s function and interfaces.}

\subsubsection*{Data}
%Internal data
The HTTP server component contains a static collection of content files, that can be served to the client side of the application.

\subsubsection*{Dependencies}
%Components to be executed before/after, excluded operations during execution
The layout component depends on both the Application State and Update Application Persistence components. If the data inside one of these components changes, the layout component has to be updated accordingly. For an overview of dependencies, see figure \ref{fig:compdependencies}.

\subsubsection*{Interfaces}

%Software requirements implemented
Provides functionality for the following software requirements:\\
SRQ12, SRQ13

%What the component does.
This component allows for adding new mixers to and removing mixers from the application persistence, from the client side of the application.

\subsubsection*{Subordinates}
%Child components (modules called, files composed of, classes used)
\todo{I've no idea whatsover}

\subsubsection*{Dependencies}
%Components to be executed before/after, excluded operations during execution
The Update Application Persistence dependes on the layout component, since it needs the data that was inputted by the user in this component to perform its tasks. It also depends on the HTTP server, to send all its requests to the server side of the application. For an overview of dependencies, see figure \ref{fig:compdependencies}.

\todo{Ask Ion}

\subsubsection*{References}
