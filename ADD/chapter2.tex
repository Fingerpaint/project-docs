%Short introduction to system context and design. Background of the project
A description of the \applicationname\ can be found in the User Requirements Document (URD) \cite{urd}. Furthermore, the Software Requirements Document (SRD) \cite{srd} includes descriptions of the background of \projectname\ and the environment it will operate in.
\projectname\ is a web-based information system. It can interact with one other information system in its environment. Figure \ref{fig:environment} shows how \projectname\ is embedded into that environment.
