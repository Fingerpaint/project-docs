\chapter{System context}
\label{chap:systcontext}
In this chapter, the context of the system is discussed. This means any external components that are used by the \applicationname{}. The \applicationname{} uses one external component: a Fortran server.

Any computations that need to be done by the \applicationname{} are offloaded to the Fortran module as described in section 2.7.4 of the SRD \cite{srd}. Communication with this module is done by calling its procedure in Fortran. This procedure simulates one mixing step and uses several parameters. Some of these parameters are parameters describing the length of other parameters, this is needed to ensure that the application only uses its own memory. These parameters are: \texttt{len\_geometry}, \texttt{len\_matrix}, \texttt{len\_concentration\_vector} and \texttt{len\_step\_name}. The other parameters are described in the table below:
