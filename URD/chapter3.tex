\chapter{Specific requirements}

This chapter explicitly states all requirements and constraints of the application to be developed. The requirements are based upon the use cases as described in \todo{Appendix A}. The final product will be delivered conform these requirements. Any requirements following from further requests can only be added after consultance with, and being granted permission by, the technical advisor and senior management.\\
The requirements are prioritised using the MoSCoW model \cite{moscow}. This model assigns one out of four priorities to each requirement: \\
\\
\emph{Must have}; requirements with this priority are essential for the product, and must be implemented. \\
\emph{Should have}; requirements with this priority are not essential for the product to work. However, they are nearly as important as the \emph{must have}'s and are therefore expected to be implemented. \\
\emph{Could have}; requirements with this priority are a nice addition to the product, and may be implemented, if time and budget allow this. \\
\emph{Won't have}; requirements with this priority will not be implemented in this version of the product, but may be nice to implement in future versions.\\
