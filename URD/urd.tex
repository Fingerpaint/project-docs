\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
This document describes the procedures and control methods to obtain the desired quality level of the end products and the process by which these end products are created. This document serves as a guide for the managers and developers of the \projectname project. All team members must read this document and apply the procedures stated in it. The document applies to all phases of software development as defined in the Project Management Plan \cite{spmp}. Detailed information about the software quality assurance activities for these phases will be added in appendices during the project.

\section{Overview}
Short description of the rest of the SRD and how it is organized.

\chapter{General description}
\section{Relation to current projects}
The context of this project in relation to other current projects.

\section{Relation to predecessor and successor projects}
The context of this project in relation to past and future projects.

\section{Function and purpose}
A general overview of the function and purpose of the product.

\section{Environment}
Hardware and operating system of target system and development system. Who will use the system (user roles in URD).

\section{Relation to other systems}
Is the project an independent system, part of a larger system, replacing another system? The essential characteristics of these other systems.
