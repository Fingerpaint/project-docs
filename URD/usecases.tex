\chapter{Use cases}
\section{View mixing history}
  \textbf{Goals}: To view the result of a mixing run.\\
  \textbf{Preconditions}: At least one mixing run must have been executed and saved.\\
  \textbf{Summary}: The performance of the selected mixing run is shown, accompanied by a picture of the final result.\\
  \textbf{Priority}: Should have.\\
  \textbf{Steps}:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The user taps the \emph{View history} button.
    \item The user taps one of the runs shown in the list.
    \item The performance result of the selected run and the final mixing result are shown.
  \end{enumerate}
  
\section{Remove mixing run from history}
  \textbf{Goals}: To remove the result of a mixing run.\\
  \textbf{Preconditions}: At least one mixing run must have been executed and saved.\\
  \textbf{Summary}: The details of the selected run (image and performance result) are removed from the history.\\
  \textbf{Priority}: Should have.\\
  \textbf{Steps}:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The user taps the \emph{View history} button.
    \item The user taps one of the runs shown in the list.
    \item The performance result of the selected run and the final mixing result are shown.
    \item The user taps the \emph{Delete} button.
    \item The details of the selected run are deleted from storage.
  \end{enumerate}
  
\section{Save mixing run image to history}
