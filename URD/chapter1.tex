\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
This document contains the requirements for \projectname. These requirements are a negotiated agreement between prof.dr.ir. P.D. Anderson and \projectauthor. All of the listed requirements, and only these, will be implemented in Fingerpaint, according to their priorities. Any changes to these requirements require the full consent of both parties.

\section{Scope}
\projectname is an application which visualises fluid mixing on a mobile device. Users can define the initial concentration, as well as manipulate the mixing protocol. The resulting fluid distribution can be stored and analysed by the user for comparison purposes.

\section{Overview}
%\todo{Short description of the rest of the URD and how it is organized.}

The remaining chapters describe the user requirements in more detail. Chapter 2 gives a general description of
\begin{itemize}
\item The relation to other systems (2.1)
\item The main capabilities (2.2)
\item Constraint information and justification (2.3)
\item User characteristics (2.4)
\item The operational environment (2.5)
\item Assumptions and dependencies (2.6)
\end{itemize}

Chapter 3 gives a detailed list of the system's capability requirements in section 3.1, and a list of the constraint requirements is given in section 3.2.
