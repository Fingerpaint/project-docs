\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
This document contains the requirements for \projectname. These requirements are a negotiated agreement between prof.dr.ir. P.D. Anderson and \projectauthor. The listed requirements will be implemented in the \applicationname according to their priorities. The requirements with the \emph{must have} priority (see chapter 3) will be assured and if time allows, other requirements might also be implemented. Any changes to these requirements require the full consent of both parties.

\section{Scope}
\projectname is an application designed and developed by \projectauthor group for prof. dr. ir. P.D. Anderson. The application provides a cross-platform tool to visualise fluid mixing. Users can define the initial concentration, as well as manipulate the mixing protocol. The resulting fluid distribution can be stored and analysed by the user for comparison purposes. \\

\section{Overview}

The remaining chapters describe the user requirements in more detail. Chapter 2 gives a general description of
\begin{itemize}
\item The relation to other systems (2.1)
\item The main capabilities (2.2)
\item Constraint information and justification (2.3)
\item User characteristics (2.4)
\item The operational environment (2.5)
\item Assumptions and dependencies (2.6)
\end{itemize}

Chapter 3 gives a detailed list of the system's capability requirements in section 3.1, and a list of the constraint requirements is given in section 3.2.
