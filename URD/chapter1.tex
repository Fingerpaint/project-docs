\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
The user requirements document (URD) contains the requirements for \projectname. These requirements are a negotiated agreement between prof.dr.ir. P.D. Anderson and \projectauthor. All of the listed requirements, and only these, will be implemented in Fingerpaint, according to their priorities. Any changes to these requirements require the full consent of both parties.

\section{Scope}
\todo{A list of software products to be developed and their intended use.}
\projectname is an application which visualises fluid mixing on a mobile device. Users can define the initial concentration, as well as manipulate the mixing protocol. The resulting fluid distribution can be stored and analyzed by the user for comparison purposes.
