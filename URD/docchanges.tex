    5 & 1.3.1 & Added colons to the definitions list. \\
    11 & 2.2.1 & Properly indented the four constraints so it is clear that we are actually describing four constraints.\\
    11 & 2.2.1 & Clarified that the user can choose between drawing using free-form drawing \emph{and} loading an initial distribution.\\

    12 & 2.6   & Added assumptions about the time it takes to transfer data back and forth, and to perform the distribution computations.\\
    12 & 3 & Reference changed: usecases are based upon requirements, not the other way around. \\
