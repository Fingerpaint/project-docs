\section{Defining an initial concentration distribution}
\label{sec:defineDist}

\subsection{Functional description}
This section describes how to define an initial concentration distribution.

\subsection{Cautions and warnings}
None.

\subsection{Procedures}
\subsubsection{Preparation}
A geometry and mixer need to have been selected to access the main menu.

\subsubsection{Description}
You can define the initial distribution by dragging across the screen. By default black fluids are added. To switch between adding black an white fluids you can press the second button from the top, the one with a black and white square displayed on it.

If the menu gets in the way of the canvas, it is possible to hide the menu by clicking the menu toggle button (the button with the "X" on it) at the top right corner of the screen.

 To adjust the size or shape of your drawing tool press the \emph{Select tool} button in the menu. A new menu will appear \ref{selectToolMenu}. Here you can change the shape of the drawing tool by pressing the button with either the square or circle shape on it. You can also change the size of your drawing tool by changing the number in the bottom of the menu. You can do this by pressing the + or - button, or by selecting the textfield and typing a size.

\screenshot{selectToolMenu}{The menu that appears after pressing \emph{Select tool} in the main menu.}

In case of a mistake, simply toggle the color of your drawing tool and drag across the unwanted area.

If you want to erase the current distribution, you can press the \emph{Clear canvas} button in the main menu to return to a completely white distribution.

\subsubsection{Results}
Fluids of the selected color are added to the distribution wherever the dragging occurs. The size and shape of the added fluids depend on the chosen tool size and shape.

\subsection{Likely errors}
Only integer numbers are allowed for the drawing tool size. Furthermore the drawing tool size can't get smaller than 1, nor bigger than 50. If the menu gets in the way of the canvas, it is possible to hide the menu by clicking the menu toggle button (the button with the "X" on it) in the top right corner of the screen.

\section{Defining and executing a mixing protocol}
\label{sec:defineMixProt}

\subsection{Functional description}
This section describes how to define the mixing protocol for the mixing simulation.

\subsection{Cautions and warnings}
None.

\subsection{Procedures}
\subsubsection{Preparation}
%There are two ways to run the simulation:\\
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Step by step
%\item Protocol
%\end{enumerate}
%
%When using step by step starts the simulation starts as soon as a step is defined. Protocol allows you to define several steps that will be executed in succession, before the mixing simulation runs.
You should be at, or navigate to, the main menu for this tutorial.

\subsubsection{Description}
A protocol can be defined by pressing the \emph{Define protocol} button in the main menu. The define protocol menu appears \ref{defineProtMenu}.

\screenshot{defineProtMenu}{The menu that appears after clicking \emph{Define protocol} in the main menu.}

The amount of time the wall should move can to be entered in the \emph{Step size} textfield. The default value is 1. You can change the value by pressing the + or - button next to the textfield, or by selecting the textfield and typing a size.

The protocol defines which wall movements should be executed in succession. You can add wall movements to the protocol by dragging the bars at the top or bottom of the canvas either left to right or right to left. The successive wall movements are displayed below the \emph{Number of steps} textfield.

The number of times the protocol should be repeated can to be entered in the \emph{Number of steps} textfield. The default value is 1. You can change the value by pressing the + or - button next to the textfield, or by selecting the textfield and typing a size.

When the protocol is satisfactory, press the \emph{Mix now} button to start the mixing simulation.

\subsubsection{Results}
The resulting concentration distribution of applying the given wall movement to the initial concentration distribution is shown on the canvas.

\subsection{Likely errors}
If the menu gets in the way of the bars on the canvas, it is possible to hide the menu by clicking the menu toggle button (the button with the "X" on it) at the top right corner of the screen. In the case that wrong wall movements are entered into the protocol, you can clear the protocol by pressing the \emph{Clear protocol} button.

This tutorial describes how to view the performance graph of the previously executed mixing run.

\subsection{Cautions and warnings}
When this tutorial is executed in Internet Explorer 10, the graph that should appear after step 1 from section  \ref{subsubsec:viewsinglegraphDesc} is not displayed. The graph that is displayed is namely in SVG format and Internet Explorer 10 cannot handle this format.

\subsection{Procedures}

\subsubsection{Preparation}
If the session from section \ref{sec:defineMixProt} has been executed, navigate to the protocols menu by pressing the \emph{Define protocol} button on the main menu.

\subsubsection{Description}\label{subsubsec:viewsinglegraphDesc}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Press the \emph{View performance graph} button.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The menu from figure \ref{fig:mixingGraphSingle} appears.
		\end{itemize}	
\end{enumerate}

\screenshot{mixingGraphSingle}{The pop-up menu that appears after clicking the \emph{View performance graph} button. The graph shown here is an example.}

\subsubsection{Results}
You have now successfully obtained a graph of the mixing performance of the previously executed mixing run. In this graph, the mixing performance is shown on the y-axis, and the corresponding protocol step is shown on the x-axis. The initial performance of the mixing run is always 1.0, so there is always a point with this value at step 0.

\subsection{Likely errors}
None.
