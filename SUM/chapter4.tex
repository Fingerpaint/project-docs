\section{Cell Browser}
\label{sec:cellBrows}
  \subsection*{Functional description}
  The Cell Browser is the first menu encountered by the user. Using the first level of the Cell Browser, the user can select the desired geometry for mixing. Currently, available geometries are the \emph{Rectangle} and the \emph{Square}. When one of the possible choices has been selected, the second level of the Cell Browser appears. This allows the user to select the desired mixer for the selected geometry. Currently, only the \emph{Default} mixers are available for both the \emph{Rectangle} and the \emph{Square} geometries.
 
  \subsection*{Cautions and warnings}
  Even though the \emph{Square} geometry has been implemented, its mixer has not. Upon trying to mix with this geometry, an error message is shown, informing the user that this mixer has not been implemented.

  \subsection*{Formal description}

\section{Drawing Area}
\label{sec:drawingarea}
  \subsection*{Functional description}
  The drawing area is used for drawing the initial concentration result. This is achieved by dragging over the canvas. Depending on the chosen colour and shape of the drawing tool, the result of fluids on the canvas changes accordingly.
  
  When loading a saved result or a saved collection of results, the canvas is used to display the loaded result. After loading, everything that was on the canvas prior to loading is removed, and replaced by what was loaded. However, after the result has been loaded, the user can freely draw on the canvas again.
  
  Lastly, the canvas is used for dragging the walls of the geometry.
  
  \subsection*{Cautions and warnings}
  The resolution of the canvas depends on the screen resolution. This means that a higher screen resolution means the canvas contains more pixels, and the drawing appears sharper. However, the internal representation for the canvas is dependant on the resolution of the geometry. In the case of the \emph{Rectangle} geometry, this resolution is a fixed $400 \times 240$. When loading results, it is possible that the resulting result appears more pixelated than it was at its creation, but the underlying data structure is unchanged.

\section{Distributions Menu}\label{sec:distmenu}
  \subsection*{Functional description}
  The \emph{Distributions} menu can be used to save, load and remove results, and to export an image of the current results to disk. Pressing the \texttt{Save} button pops up a menu, in which the desired name can be entered. If that name already exists, the user can choose to overwrite that name, or choose a new name.
  
  Pressing the \texttt{Load} button causes a menu to appear, containing the names of all saved results. If there are no saved results, the user is notified of this fact. If there are more results than fit on the screen, scrollbars appear to allow the user to view all parts of list of saved results.
  
  The \texttt{Remove} button creates a pop-up panel containing the names of all saved results. Next to each of these names is a delete button that can be used to delete the result. Deleting a result cannot be undone. 
  
  The \texttt{Export Image} button allows the user to download an image of the current result. This generates a \emph{PNG} file that can be downloaded to the client's device using the browser's download functionality.
  
  The \texttt{Back} button can be used to return to the main menu.

  \subsection*{Cautions and warnings}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The load and remove buttons have reduced functionality if no results were saved.
    \item The capacity of the local storage is limited. When it is full, results or other saved \projectname{} items must be removed, before saving is possible again. The user is notified of a full local storage. Note that the local storage's capacity can be exceeded even though there is enough free disk space, as each website can only save a certain amount of data in the local storage.
