\projectname{} is an application that serves as an educational tool for anyone who wants to
gain a deeper understanding of the process of mixing fluids in general, and in particular for students
at the TU/e. By interacting with the application, users can quickly and easily find out what
the effects of a certain mixer and mixing protocol on an initial fluid distribution are. The user can
thus obtain a better understanding about the way this mixer functions. \projectname{} may
also be used as a quick and convenient way to observe whether a mixing protocol renders
good or bad mixing results, and for comparing different results.
