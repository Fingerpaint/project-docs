The \applicationname is a web application that runs locally in the browser. The client has indicated it should be implemented in HTML5. At the moment, HTML5 is a sort of ``umbrella definition'' for a lot of technologies. In practice, what we will do is implement the application in JavaScript (JS), making heavy use of the canvas element and everything it supports. Note that currently, the canvas element supports quite a lot of features: simple things like drawing rectangles, but also drawing curves and more complex shapes (polygons) is supported. Even creating effects like blur or inverting colors belongs to the possibilities. Finally, 3D-drawing is supported. We will not make use of the latter, but the idea is clear: with a canvas, we will be able to do anything the client wants.

To make developing the software easier, we will use a couple of frameworks. This will enable us to document the code more easily and more clearly (including generating documentation from the comments in the code). Additionally, it will enable automated testing. This will be explained below.

\section{Google Web Toolkit (GWT)}
The GWT\footnote{The homepage of GWT can be found at \url{https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/}.} is a toolkit that provides two things:
\begin{itemize}
	\item possibility to develop (complex) browser-based applications productively;
	\item optimised JS generated by GWT provides the user with a high-performance end product.
\end{itemize}
A great advantage of the GWT to us is that it enables developers to create web applications without requiring the developer to be an expert in browser quirks or JS. A developer simply needs to know Java (which is well-known and easy to learn) to understand the code of the application.

Finally, the GWT includes a plugin for Eclipse and an extension for Chrome to profile the application, which makes developing again more productive.

\section{Selenium}
From the start of the project, we want to be able to test the software automatically. As we are developing a web application here, an important part is user experience. Of course, one of the most important facets of the user experience is the visual facet: what does it look like? Of course, it is very labour intensive to test this manually: that would require a tester to open the application in a number of browsers and perform the same sequence of actions in every browser. Still then, probably just a subset of all available browsers will be tested. It is simply impossible to test both browsers on desktop Windows, Mac and Linux machines and on mobile iOS and Android machines - which are not even \emph{all} platforms available on the market.

Selenium\footnote{The homepage of Selenium can be found at \url{http://docs.seleniumhq.org/}.} is a library that can aid here. It is multilingual, including Java, which is our choice. Selenium provides a means of creating and executing tests in a lot of browsers, including mobile browsers for iPhone and Android. A test in this context is literally a sequence of actions \emph{as the user could perform them}. It is possible to click elements, type text, submit forms, drag-and-drop, simulate clicks, et cetera.

The code base of Selenium also includes a server. This server can be used to run actual tests on a remote machine, while the program that is issuing the tests runs on a local machine. Commands/actions are sent to the server through a tunnel, the server executes those actions in a browser of choice and returns the results to the local machine, when asked for. This functionality is used by us to be able to run tests from any machine on a number of different platforms.
