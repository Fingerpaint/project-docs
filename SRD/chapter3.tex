\chapter{Specific requirements}
\label{chap:specreq}
\todo{chapter description}
The structure of the software requirements in this section are conform the user requirements described in chapter 3 of the URD \cite{urd}. \\
Note that as \applicationname\ is developed using GWT, some of the software requirements listed in this chapter are described in terms of specific GWT widgets or panels \footnote{The website for the GWT widgetlist can be found at https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/doc/latest/RefWidgetGallery.}.
