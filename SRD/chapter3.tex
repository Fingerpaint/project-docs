\chapter{Specific requirements}
\label{chap:specreq}
This chapter lists all specific software requirements of the application to be developed, both functional and non-functional requirements. The requirements are categorised according to the interface they belong to, as described in section \ref{sec:moddesc}.

Each requirement has a specific priority, based on the MoSCoW model \cite{moscow}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{must have}; requirements with this priority are essential for the product, and must be implemented.
    \item \emph{should have}; requirements with this priority are not essential for the product to work. However, they are nearly as important as the \emph{must have}'s and are therefore expected to be implemented.
    \item \emph{could have}; requirements with this priority are a nice addition to the product, and may be implemented, if time and budget allow this.
    \item \emph{won't have}; requirements with this priority will not be implemented in this version of the product, but may be nice to implement in future versions.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Only those user requirements from the URD \cite{urd} with a priority higher than \emph{won't have} will be translated to software requirements in this chapter.

\fpstartparagraph{} In some of the requirements in this section, the term ``fast enough" is mentioned: for a precise definition, refer to chapter 6 of the ADD \cite{add}.

\SRQ[CB-5]{must have}{A graphical user interface is present to reset the current initial concentration distribution to a completely white state.} % CPR8

\subsubsection{Select a geometry, mixer and initial concentration distribution}
The user can select a rectangular mixer geometry. Then the user can select a mixer that can operate on the selected geometry and an initial concentration distribution. This translates to the following software requirements:

\SRQ[CB-10]{could have}{After the list of concentration distribution from \srqref{predef} is presented, a predefined concentration distribution can be selected and loaded onto the canvas.} % CPR14

\subsubsection{Define mixing protocol for specific geometries}
A mixing protocol consists of movements of the geometry (if applicable), and how long these movements are executed. Different movement types are possible for each geometry. A step of a mixing protocol has a certain duration (the step size, $D$). This duration $D$ can be any multiple of $0.25$. If a value is not a multiple of $0.25$, it will be rounded to the nearest valid value. For example, $4.2$ is rounded up to $4.25$, while $4.1$ is rounded down to $4$. Each movement is performed for $D$ time units, which can be set using \srqref{stepsize}. Depending on the geometry, a step has additional parameters signifying which part moves and how:

\fpstartparagraph{} For the \emph{rectangular} or \emph{square} geometries, a wall movement is defined by either $T$ or $B$, denoting a movement of the top or bottom wall, respectively. These movements can be combined with a $L$ or $R$ denoting whether the wall is moving left or right. This means there are four movement modifiers: $TL$, $TR$, $BL$ and $BR$.

The \emph{circular} geometry only supports one (unnamed) modifier.

For the \emph{journal bearing} geometry, movements are defined by rotating the outer or inner circle. The outer circle is denoted with an $O$ and the inner circle is denoted with an $I$. These modifiers can be combined with modifiers denoting the direction of the rotation, $R$ and $L$. This results in four possible modifiers: $OL$, $OR$, $IL$ and $IR$.

The user interface will contain options to input modifiers where appropriate and to indicate the step-size associated with those modifiers.

\fpstartparagraph{} A graphical interface is present to define how many times the current protocol should be run when the simulation has started.

\SRQ[stepsize]{must have}{ % CPR20

    A graphical user interface is present to reset the currently defined protocol, thereby removing all currently defined steps.
}

\subsubsection{Execute mixing runs}
The user can choose to execute a single step of a mixing protocol, by defining a single step. This is done by choosing one wall movement and its duration. This invokes \srqref{startMixing}, \srqref{sendParams}, \srqref{execMixing}, \srqref{returnParams} and \srqref{visResults}.

\SRQ[CB-17]{must have}{ % CPR18
    After selecting a geometry, a mixer, an initial distribution and a single step, the user can execute a mixing run with this single step.}

\subsubsection{Visualising the results}
The concentration distribution resulting from a mixing simulation is visualised in the user interface, using the canvas that was originally used to draw the initial concentration distribution. The performance results are visualised in a graph.

\SRQ[visResults]{must have}{ % CPR29e
    Concentration distributions can be drawn on the client's canvas.

    After \srqref{selgeomrec}, \srqref{selgeomsq}, \srqref{selgeomcir} or \srqref{selgeomjb}, the user can load a predefined mixing protocol. This opens a menu containing all suitable predefined mixing protocols for the selected geometry. Pressing the name of one such protocol selects it, which means it will be loaded into the application. After this it can be changed or used for simulation immediately.
}

\subsubsection{Save and remove mixing runs}

\subsubsection{Exporting results}
It is possible to save an image of the results of a performed mixing run to the disk of the Client. This can be an image of the resulting concentration distribution, an animation of several intermediate concentration distributions (as indicated by the step-repeat from \srqref{protocolrepeat}) or a graph displaying the performance of a mixing run (a performance point is generated for each time the protocol was repeated using \srqref{protocolrepeat}).

%CPR30&36
