\todo{chapter description}
The structure of the software requirements in this section are conform the user requirements described in chapter 3 of the URD \cite{urd}. \\
Note that as \applicationname\ is developed using GWT, some of the software requirements listed in this chapter are described in terms of specific GWT widgets or panels\footnote{The website for the GWT widgetlist can be found at \url{https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/doc/latest/RefWidgetGallery}.}.

\todo{Nog even vermelden dat we de won't haves uit het URD niet beschrijven in dit SRD.}

\section{Functional requirements}
\label{sec:funcreq}

Requirements regarding the mixer geometry input: \\
\SRQ{must have}{The user can select ``rectangle" as a geometry, via the first column in a Cell Browser.} % CPR1
\SRQ{must have}{After having selected a geometry, the user can select a mixer that fits the selected geometry. The mixer can be selected via a second column in a Cell Browser.} % CPR2
\SRQ{should have}{The user can select ``square" as a geometry, via the first column in a Cell Browser.}  % CPR3
\SRQ{could have}{The user can select ``circle" as a geometry, via the first column in a Cell Browser.}  % CPR4
\SRQ{could have}{The user can select ``\emph{Journal Bearing}" as a geometry, via the first column in a Cell Browser.}  % CPR5

Requirements regarding the initial concentration distribution input: \\

\todo{VRAAG: moeten we er een losse requirement van maken dat de user op een canvas tekent? Ik vind het uit onderstaande
 requirements nu niet geheel duidelijk dat het om exact hetzelfde canvas gaat iedere keer.}

\SRQ{must have}{The user can select a colour (black or white) to paint with for the initial concentration distribution, via a Toggle Button.} % CPR6
\SRQ{must have}{The user can define an initial concentration distribution with the selected colour on the canvas, by drawing with their finger.} % CPR6
\SRQ{must have}{The user can select a circle-shaped drawing tool via a pop-up panel.} % CPR7
\label{srq:circleshaped}
\SRQ{must have}{The user can draw with a circle-shaped drawing tool on the canvas.} % CPR7, los omdat de square een lagere prioriteit heeft in het URD
\SRQ{must have}{The user can reset the current concentration distribution to a completely white concentration distribution, by clicking on the ``Reset" button.} % CPR8
\SRQ{should have}{The user can select a square-shaped drawing tool via a pop-up panel.} % CPR9
\label{srq:squareshaped}
\SRQ{should have}{The user can draw with a square-shaped drawing tool on the canvas.} % CPR9
\SRQ{should have}{The user can adjust the size of the drawing tool, using a slider in the Popup Panel from \ref{srq:circleshaped} and \ref{srq:squareshaped}.} % CPR10
\SRQ{should have}{The user can save an initial concentration distribution locally on their device, using a Button and Popup Panel.} % CPR11
\SRQ{should have}{The user can remove a previously saved initial concentration distribution.} % CPR12
% Hetzelfde als Roel hier, een button met ``Remove", dan een lijst met checkboxes en dan met dezelfde knop Removen?



Requirements regarding the presentation of results: \\
The user is able to visualise his mixing protocol, as well as able to save and export these results. To this end a results window is available. In the results window there is a `show statistics' button. When pressed, the performance of the mixing run is shown in a graph. The results window is reached by pressing the `start mixing' button in the mixing protocol window. The mixing protocol window is the window where the user can define his mixing protocol. In the mixing protocol window there is a `animate mixing' checkbox. If this checkbox was checked when the `start mixing' button is pressed, an animation of the mixing procedure is shown in the results window.

\SRQ{must have}{In the results window the result of the user's mixing protocol is shown.}
%CPR32

\SRQ{must have}{The user can use the `show performance' button to get visual information of the performance of the mixing run.}
%CPR34

\SRQ{could have}{An animation of the mixing run is shown in the results window if the `animate mixing' checkbox is checked.}
%CPR38

Requirements regarding saving and exporting results: \\
In the results window a `save' button, an `export' button and a `load results' button are available. If the `export' button is pressed, a popup with several available export options is shown: `export performance', `export picture' and `export animation'. `export animation' is only available if the `animate mixing' checkbox was checked. Additionally, a `load performance' button. The user can use this button to open a popup. In this popup he can select the files he wants to load. The button changes to `load selected' and now loads all the selected files.

\SRQ{should have}{The `export picture' option can be used to export an image of the mixing result somewhere on the device.}
%CPR33

\SRQ{should have}{The `export performance' option can be used to export an image of the current performance graph somewhere on the device.}
%CPR35&37

\SRQ{should have}{Data loaded with the `load performance' button is depicted in a single performance graph.} 
%CPR36

\SRQ{could have}{The `export animation' button can be used to export an animation of the mixing procedure somewhere on the device.}
%CPR39

Language selection: \\
In the menu bar a flag of the currently selected language is visible. When clicked, a popup appears containing several language options, each symbolised by the flag of their country. These flags can be clicked to change the language to that specific language. Standard language is English.

\SRQ{should have}{It should be possible to switch to Dutch langage with the language menu.}
%CPR41
